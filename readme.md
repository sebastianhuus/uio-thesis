# uio-thesis

I made this template for fun because I wanted to learn Typst for a different project. I figured something like this could be useful to future students at UiO and maybe for myself if I do my master's at UiO.

Note to potential users: I think UiO handles the cover page for you, so they'll most likely ask you to submit it without a front page (which I put the most effort into for this project). However I did try to implement some nice features for the first pages and thesis structure. 

## HELP WANTED
I dunno how to put this onto Typst universe. I just use Typst's browser app, but it seems packages like this must be run locally and tested. 

I tried setting it up and running it locally but document doesn't build.

Feel free to make a pull request so we can put this on Typst UniverseðŸ™Œ

## Notes
- This project was made in Typst 0.12. Doesn't work in the Typst web app on 0.13.
